  "And when their focus starts to fade away,",
  "Say: “So Judge…” — it brings them back your way!",

  "Hear the opponent echo, steal their phrase with might,",
  "Write their question down — then answer it tight.",
  "And if you’re not sure? Say this with precision:",
  "“Based on our team’s position.”",

  "Ask the arrow question — sharp and lean,",
  "No rambling detours — just keep it clean.",
  "Use cross-x smart — it’s your hidden machine,",
  "Point it at gaps — make your logic seen",

  "Music in your voice — let it rise and fall,",
  "Hold your paper chest-high — not a face-blocking wall.",
  "Pause… after… points… that matter the most,",
  "It gives time to think — and lets your words boast.",

  "Pass the sticky note, whisper the proof — smooth team play,",
  "Support your partner, don’t drift away.",
  "Nod when they speak, keep your rhythm tight,",
  "Two voices, one mind — you’ll win that fight.",

  "Invent a save — when things go south,",
  "Don’t freeze — let smart words leave your mouth.",
  "Say: “They said… but here’s why we still lead…”",
  "Or “I hear that… but here’s what we need.”",
  "Make notes as they talk — reframe with grace,",
  "Turn pressure into your winning case!",

  "Outline your close — don’t leave it to chance,",
  "Say: “Judge, three things…” — then give them a stance.",
  "Be clear, be clean — your final lines,",
  "Should echo like bells or courtroom chimes.",
  "Wrap it with heart — confident and just,",
  "“That is why, Judge, you should side with us.”",

  "Nice face wins — so let your warmth shine,",
  "A calm, kind tone makes your logic divine.",
  "Don’t snarl, don’t glare — even when you’re right,",
  "Charm wins rounds — more than a fight.",

  "That’s CHAMPION — literally!",
  "Convince the judge, speak fearlessly.",
  "Respect, rhythm, and unity —",
  "That’s debate done brilliantly."
